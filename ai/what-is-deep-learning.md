# What is deep learning?

After reading quite a few book chapters, posts on the internet, watching online courses and videos. I finally landed at an amazingly concise and easy to understand [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-WRlEFefw) created by 李宏毅, a professor of NTU.

### What is deep learning(very very high level)

- **Neuron**: Neuron is basically a logistic regression followed by a activation function.
- **Neural Network**: connect neurons to a network structure, layer by layer. AKA a function set.
- **Train**: train the parameters, or weights.

That's it! Very simple, right?
