# URL Shortener

One approach to shorten URL is having a increasing counter for each long URL and then encode it to base62 string, with characters from [0-9A-Za-a].

There is a good explanation of the solution and some sample code links in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/742013/how-to-code-a-url-shortener/742047#742047).

You can also refer [this post](https://hackernoon.com/aws-lambda-build-yourself-a-url-shortener-in-2-hours-94f9627ed4a6) for building your own URL shortener service with AWS Lambda.
