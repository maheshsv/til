- **View**: draw something user can see and interact with, aka "widgets", such as button, TextView etc.
- **ViewGroup**: invisible container defines the layout structure for **View** and other **ViewGroup** objects, aks "layouts", such as LinearLayout or ConstraintLayout.

### Two ways to declare layout

- Declare UI elements in XML.
- Instantiate layout elements at runtime.
