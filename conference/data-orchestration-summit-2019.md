# Data Orchestration Summit 2019

Presentations and slides are available [here](https://www.alluxio.io/data-orchestration-summit-2019/).

Other than some of the cool presentations, it was really nice talking with awesome folks in the industry from companies like: openstack, Google, EA, Petuum, Ali cloud, Tencent cloud, netflix and learn cool projects and new features about Alluxio, Presto, Tensorflow, Airflow, Iceburg, Kubernestes etc.
