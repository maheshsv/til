# Cool Technologies

Technologies are moving so fast!

### 20191203 update:

It's 2019 AWS re:invent, and there are lots of cool technologies announced. Here is a list that I am interested:

- [AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator)](https://pages.awscloud.com/AQUA_Preview.html) is a new distributed and hardware accelerated cache that allows Redshift to run up to 10x faster than any other cloud data warehouse. It brings compute closer to storage, again.
- [Amazon EKS on AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-on-aws-fargate-now-generally-available/)
- [UltraWarm (Preview) for Amazon Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-ultrawarm-preview-for-amazon-elasticsearch-service/) is a fully managed, low-cost, warm storage tier for Amazon Elasticsearch Service. And both ultrawarm and AQUA mentioned [AWS Nitro System](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/).
- [Amazon CodeGuru](https://aws.amazon.com/codeguru/) is a machine learning service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations.

And another cool technology from AWS I found interesting recently is [Amazon Athenaâ€™s federated query](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/query-any-data-source-with-amazon-athenas-new-federated-query/).
