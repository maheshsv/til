# Set Good Examples

> Set good examples, because people will follow.

> â€‹										- from an experienced developer

For almost every internet companies I worked for, software quality is an issue, and sometimes it's one of the biggest issues in the company, no matter it's a startup or a famous tech giant. And even for some of the brand new projects, tech debts were accumulating very fast. 

One of the best advice I heard about avoiding tech debt is **set good example**. Because people who joined the party later are trying to follow the coding style, naming covention, testing methods and so on. So it's very important to set good examples for them.

On the other hand, for thoes who start to work with existing codebase, instead of blindly follow how things works today, try to understand the reasons behind these decisions and think if there is any better way to do things. **Challenge the status quo.** 

Another extreme we want to avoid is that just blaming the code is bad and attempt to rewrite everyting. It's common and easy for new comer to say the code is sh*t, but re-write everyting rarely fixes the problems and not to mention the cost.
