# Effective Java 3rd Edition

## General Principles

- Clarity and simplicity are of paramount importance.
- Components should be as small as possible but not smaller.
- Code should be reused rather than copied.
- Dependency between components should be kept to a minimum.
- Error should be detected ASAP, ideally at compile time.

Four kinds of types:

- interfaces(including annotations)
- classes(including enums)
- arrays
- primitives

A class's members consists of:

- fields
- methods
- member classes
- member interfaces
