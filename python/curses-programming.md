# Curses Programming

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)).

> curses** is a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) control [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science)) for [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems, enabling the construction of [text user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_user_interface) (TUI) applications.

The `curses` library in Python wraps over C curses functions.

It's interesting to see [game](https://github.com/guihaojin/code-snippets/blob/master/python/games/snake.py) developed with TUI at web age. :-)
