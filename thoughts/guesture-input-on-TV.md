# Guesture Input on TV

Input on TV or other similar devices is painful these days, even if they are claimed to be "smart". Usually when you want to enter some information, for example, username and password. They will bring up a keyboard on the screen, and then you need to nevigate around and enter the characrters one by one. This is very cubersome! And for this reason, most of the time I don't bother to key in anything unless it's absolutely necessary. 

As AI/DL is rising in popularity, I think it's very likely that **we can leverage these technologies and create a smarter way for input on these devices**. Here I will provide some food for thought. For example, almost all of these devices come with camera. So we can use computer vision + guesture as a replacment for keyboard + remote. More specifically, the camera can track our finger tip and predict what the input character is. I think this approach is very feasible as DL is getting more and more mature.
