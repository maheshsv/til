# Netflix Culture Deck

Netflix has a [page](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture) dedicated for Netflix Culture. Initially I was think it's just another "slogan". But after I read it, I found it's actually very well written. 

I admit the standard is very high and I doubt if there are many employee of Netflix can meet the bar. But it's definitely a good reference for anyone who want to **do a greate job** in their career.
