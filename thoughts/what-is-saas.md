# What is SaaS?

SaaS stands for Software as a Service. The definition on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) is: 

> **Software as a service** is a software [licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_licensing) and [delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_delivery) model in which software is licensed on a [subscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription) basis and is centrally [hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service). It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft). ...

But with this definition, we still cannot tell if Google search is SaaS, if facebook is SaaS, and if Netflix is SaaS.

After giving it many thoughts, my answer to this question is that:

It depends on the context of the question, meaning if it's a SaaS business or SaaS software development/delivery paradigm. 

For example: if you ask if Google search is a SaaS business. The answer is obviously no. Because the service is free and they earn money by selling ads. But is Google search a SaaS software? my answer is Yes. Because it's truely an on-demand Search as a Service software, it's accessed by thin client such as web browser, so you don't need to install Google to use it. All of these properties fit into the definition of SaaS product except it's not a SaaS business. But if someday Google says: you need to pay 10 dollars/month to use Google search. Then boom, it becomes a SaaS business. 

A common misunderstanding of SaaS business is that the clients need to be enterprise. Actually that's not necessary.
