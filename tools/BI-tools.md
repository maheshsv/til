# BI Tools: Redash, Metabase and Superset

Our company have been doing some research and playing around with BI tools recently.
Here is a list of BI tools we think are very interesting, powerful and worth exploring.

### Redash

[Redash](https://redash.io/) is an [open source](https://github.com/getredash/redash) BI tools that supports
querying from a variety of data sources, visualizing and sharing the results. It's tech stack is: Angular for the frontend, Python/Flask on the backend, Postgres as the storage, use Redis and celery for offline tasks.

### Metabase

[Metabase](http://www.metabase.com/) is another [open source](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) BI and analytics tools similar to Redash. It's written in clojure.

### Superset

Apache [Superset](https://github.com/airbnb/superset) is yet another BI tool open sourced by Airbnb. It's written in Python. The data sources it supports is less than Redash and Metabase but the UI/UX looks cool.
