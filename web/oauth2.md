# OAuth 2.0

>  [ OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on   behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. 

### Roles:

- resource owner
- resource server
- client
- authorization server

### Protocol Flow

### Protocol Endpoints

- Authorization endpoint: used by client to obtain authorization from the resource owner
- Token endpoint: used by client to exchange an authorization grant for an access token
- Redirection endpoint: used by authorization server to return responses containing authorization credentials to the client via the resource owner user-agent.
